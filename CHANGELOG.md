# Changelog

## 0.1.3

- Wired the `merovingian-server` binary to actually serve traffic: it now opens TCP listeners for the configured client (and federation, when enabled) binds, accepts HTTP/1.1 connections, parses request heads through the existing transport limits, and dispatches them to the local HTTP router.
- Added `merovingian::net::TcpAcceptor` (RAII TCP listening socket via `getaddrinfo`, `SO_REUSEADDR`, `IPV6_V6ONLY`, `getsockname`-reported bound port) and `merovingian::net::ShutdownSignal` (signal-safe self-pipe + SIGINT/SIGTERM handler installer).
- Added `merovingian::homeserver::serve_http`, a single-threaded-per-acceptor accept/parse/dispatch loop that serialises shared runtime mutation through a caller-provided mutex and respects the existing `http::RequestLimits`.
- Added a `--dry-run` CLI flag that runs config validation and prints the startup summary without binding any listeners; previous smoke tests now opt in via `--dry-run`.
- TLS listeners (`tls=true`) fail closed at startup with a "TLS not yet implemented" error until the crypto stack is in place.
- New exit codes `runtime_start_error` (80) and `listener_error` (81) for failures after configuration validation.
- New BDD coverage: `test_tcp_acceptor`, `test_shutdown_signal`, and `test_http_server_listener_flow` (end-to-end loopback HTTP exchange against a started runtime).

## 0.1.2

- Preserved media repository and admin HTTP status codes through local homeserver routes.
- Added regression coverage for unauthenticated media uploads, admin media misses, quarantined downloads, remote media rejection, and zero-reference blob reupload.
- Documented the media repository status, digest, audit, and schema migration behavior.

## 0.1.1

- Added a Linux/BSD developer environment setup script with dry-run, check-only, package-manager override, and Meson build-directory configuration support.
- Documented the developer environment workflow and linked it from the README.
- Added smoke coverage for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD setup command planning.

## 0.1.0

- Initial secure bootstrap implementation with Meson build, configuration validation, runtime summaries, and security-focused test scaffolding.
